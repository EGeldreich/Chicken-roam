Users are solely responsible for the welfare of their chickens and the design of their chicken runs. Chicken Roam and its creator(s) accept no liability for any decisions made or actions taken based on the information provided by this website.

The objectives and requirements calculated by this tool are approximate guidelines only and may need to be adjusted based on your specific circumstances, local regulations, climate conditions, and the specific needs of your chickens.

## Sources & References

The information and guidelines provided by Chicken Roam are based on general knowledge gathered from various sources and personal experience. These recommendations should be considered as starting points rather than definitive requirements.

We strongly encourage users to:

- Consult local regulations regarding the keeping of chickens in your area
- Research breed-specific needs for your particular chickens
- Consider your local climate and environmental conditions
- Seek advice from experienced chicken keepers or agricultural professionals

The objectives in Chicken Roam are intended as helpful guidelines only. Actual requirements may vary significantly based on breed, climate, predator presence, and other local factors.

This tool is primarily a web development learning project, and while we strive for accuracy, the practical application of chicken husbandry knowledge is secondary to the educational coding aspects of the project.

## Project Purpose

Chicken Roam was created with three main objectives, in order of priority:

1. Learning Exercise: First and foremost, this project serves as a practical learning exercise in web development. It represents the application of programming skills, user interface design, and database management in a real-world context.

2. Frontend Development Showcase: Secondly, Chicken Roam is designed as a frontend-heavy application that demonstrates interactive capabilities, including a dynamic canvas for planning and element manipulation.

3. Practical Tool: Finally, the project aims to provide a useful tool for chicken enthusiasts to plan their outdoor chicken runs by visualizing enclosures and calculating basic requirements based on flock size.

As a completely free tool, Chicken Roam is offered to the community as both a demonstration of web development skills and a practical planning resource. While we've attempted to make the chicken run recommendations reasonable, the educational aspects of creating this application remain the primary focus.

We welcome feedback both on the technical aspects of the website and on the usefulness of the planning tool for chicken keepers.

## Attributions
